Throughout the year, the team competes at local tournaments, also participating at the national level. Given diverse selection of competitive categories, it truly has something for everyone: those interested in debate or politics can hone their skills, while those who enjoy acting can perform monologues or duos. Meanwhile, writers can compose and deliver original speeches, and readers can present their interpretations of prose, poetry, or drama excerpts. Anyone who likes to express themselves, perform, argue or talk would greatly enjoy speech and debate. However, even students who are a little stage shy are more than welcome to join, and frequently find success as they gain poise and self-confidence. A longstanding tradition at Freehold Township, the team has had great success at both state and local levels.</h2>
